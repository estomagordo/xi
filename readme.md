### Picking the greatest ever XI

Subject to the following rules:

* Players must have played while you were alive.
* No two players from the same country
* No two players who have represented the same club

As detailed [in this tweet](https://twitter.com/Carra23/status/1250066001821130759)

Anyone can use this utitlity to find their own dream eleven.

Just add, remove or edit any data as you see fit. The last value for a player is a subjective rating
on that player's strength, or quality as a player. Obviously make sure you agree with this before
running the program.

To run: Make sure your system has Python 3 installed. Then open a terminal and the same directory as xi.py and type
> python xi.py

That's it. By default, it displayes the three best elevens for 4-3-3, 4-4-2 and 3-4-3 formations.
This is obviously configurable too.
